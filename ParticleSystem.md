<p align = "center">The purpose of this project was to create a particle system and an accompanying technical report reinforcing my ability to use C++, OpenGL and GLUT. I opted to create a 2D particle system with some built in options to change the texture. This essentially furthered my work in OpenGL but also tested my ability of memory management in C++. Additional features of this program were menu options, changing textures,  changing the amount of explosions, changing the amount of particles per explosion, changing the size of the texture, changing the colour of the explosion, as well as the explosions spread and lifetime.</p>
