<p align = "center">The second year of my degree (September 2011 â€“ May 2012). This year had a lot of modules. Data Structures & Algorithms proved to be the most difficult and was structured to explore certain data structures and algorithms using an abstract language for theory and Java for the practical component.  Networks & Communications gave an insight into TCP/IP, encoding/decoding and a general network and communications overview. The practical side of this module was done in Java. Programming in C & C++ gave an introduction to C and C++ completing various exercises and finally to inverse a bitmap image at the end of the year. This module was only available to Games Development students. The Software Engineering & Group Project module consists of UML, the software development process, project management and had a large group project attached where in a group of 5 people, we created a digital version (using C# and XNA) of the board game, a Game of Life. The Professional Computing Practice module was a small module based around CVs, interview techniques, etc.</p>

<p align = "center">Games Programming was a module that was a group project to create a game in C# and XNA. I worked in a two-man team. The game produced in this module was then taken on and developed further within the Tournaments in Computing module. You can read more about Chopper Command: Tactical War, which was chosen to enter into, and eventually win, the Games Fleadh here. We would be joined by one other student, creating a 3 man team for another project for the Tournaments in Computing module, eventually entering and being picked for the Microsoft Imagine Cup with Geography Horizons, explained further here.</p>
