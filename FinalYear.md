<p align = "center">The fourth and final year of my degree (September 2014 â€“ May 2015). The modules this year were some of the most difficult of the entire degree, specifically Algorithms: Analysis & Application and High Performance Computing. Algorithms consisted of complexities, average and worst case analysis of algorithms, searching and sorting algorithms, string matching, graph algorithms and NP-Complete problems. High Performance Computing focussed on parallel programming in C using OpenMP, MPI and CUDA for searching for a pattern within a string. These modules were difficult but extremely useful, interesting and challenging.</p>

<p align = "center">The other modules in this year were Advanced Software Engineering and Innovation & Entrepreneurship. Advanced Software Engineering consisted of UML, OCL, Design Principles and Patterns for Software Engineering, Architecture Models and more. The Innovation & Entrepreneurship module was working in a team of 4 to create a business idea, prototype and plan. Our team went with my idea of a digital business card replacement and fleshed it out into a idea spanning multiple devices and a network. We entered the Citi UpStart Competition with this idea and received great feedback.</p>

<p align = "center">The biggest module of this year was the Individual Research Project, my Dissertation, which you can read in more detail here.</p>
