<h2>Bluebear Technologies</h2>

<p align="center">For my placement year (August 2013 – August 2014) I worked as a game developer for a small games company in Dublin called Bluebear Technologies Ltd. Bluebear are a small team that focuses on high quality games and apps targeted towards children and the casual games market on iOS and Android. During my time there I completed 21 apps individually, after being provided a short brief of the game and the art for the game. I worked with Cocos2D-x and C++, as well as Cocos2D and Objective-C. In addition to these apps I also worked on a number of Bluebear’s older applications, bug fixing and updating the apps for iPad.</p>

<h2>Queen's University Belfast</h2>

<p align="center">I have also had part time work on the Queen’s University Belfast campus as a demonstrator in the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science for a number of years. I was a demonstrator in 2012-2013 for Fundamentals of Programming and Introduction to Multimedia II, and in 2014-2015 for Fundamentals of Programming, Introduction to Software Engineering and Project Management, and Educational Multimedia. This role allowed me to work with different years in the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, helping them with their work and demonstrating my experience and knowledge with the technologies and work they were doing.</p>

<p align="center">Demonstrating is essentially working as a classroom assistant, lending a hand to any students that need help, and it allowed me to develop my interpersonal skills further and learn skills that I may not have had the chance to otherwise. I really enjoyed demonstrating as I got to meet new people and help those who found the content difficult.</p>

<h2>Queen's Computing Society</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/images/qcslogo.png" alt="QCS Logo" align="middle"></p>

<p align="center">I was a founding member of the QCS and held the following roles:</p>
<br>
<ul class="skill-list">
<li>Head of PR (March 2011-2012)</li>
<li>Vice President (March 2012-2013)</li>
<li>Head of PR (March 2014-March 2015)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p align="center">The QCS was set up to create a community within the School of EEECS at Queen’s. We wanted to break away from the stigma of computing students being anti-social and provide fun events for anyone that wished to attend. During those 4 years we organised pub crawls, pub quizes, formals, industry talks, a mystery tour, hackathons and more. Whether it was designing posters, creating events, organising with companies or convincing people to go, I always had fun in the QCS and hope it continues long into the future. I developed as a person and met a lot of friends through this society and feel like we made a positive impact during our time at Queens.</p>

<h2>GAME Ltd</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/images/gamelogo.png" alt="GAME Logo" align="middle"></p>

<p align="center">From September to December of 2010 I was a retail assistant in the games retail company, GAME.  I experienced customer service, tilling experience, merchandising, store clean-up, team work and daily target meeting/recording. Though just a Christmas Temp, I enjoyed my time in GAME and frequently spent my wages on products in-store, a vicious circle that many would not be surprised at!</p>
