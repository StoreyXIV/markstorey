<p align = "center">Abstract</p>

<p align = "center">To create a realistic environment or game, shadows are needed, but it is difficult to know to what extent. With limited resources, developers must manage how they spend their resources and what to spend them on. Research has been conducted over what shadow algorithm developers can use, in terms of speed and quality, but the human perception of shadows and their importance within a 3D game or environment has not been explored. This dissertation explores the human perception of shadow quality, in an attempt to find reasoning to use as few resources as possible. An experiment is conducted to test whether an object’s prominence plays a role in a user’s perception of a scene, as well as determine at what point a user finds shadows acceptable within a scene, ranging from no shadows to high quality shadows. Using what a user expects in these situations give an insight into the amount of resources developers need to use for shadows. This study concludes that the human perception of shadows within a scene are lower than expected. Only 32% of users noticed the high prominence object had a missing shadow, despite being an obvious part of the scene, whilst medium quality or lower is chosen for both acceptance and preference throughout the experiment. These results allow the conclusion that developers can save on resources by using lower quality shadows, without degrading the perception of quality within their scene, allowing them to spend their limited resources elsewhere for the 3D game or environment.</p>
