<p align = "center">As part of a two-man team, I created a game in C# and XNA based on the original Atari 2600 game, Chopper Command. Our idea was to modernise the original game, adding in procedurally generated terrain, with peak detection and smoothing, and a turret system to blend the side scroller with a tower defence-esque feel. The game also features multiple enemies, cash system, controller and keyboard support as well as UI and a minimap.</p>
