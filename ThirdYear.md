<p align = "center">The third year of my degree (September 2012 â€“ May 2013). In this year I got to experience working in a large team (for uni) of 7 people using the agile methodology in Agile & Component Based Development. In this module we created a COLLADA model importer and imported a model of a goblin into C# in our first sprint. In the second sprint we controlled the goblin using Microsoft Kinect. The Concurrent Programming and Artificial Intelligence modules were a lot more theory-based. Concurrent focused on mutual exclusion, monitors, semaphores, concurrency, deadlock, safety and liveness. We tended to use Java for this module. Artificial Intelligence consisted of propositional calculus, predicate calculus, fuzzy logic, PROLOG, expert systems (probability, chaining, tree searching), neural networks, linguistics and speech recognition. This was a very theory-heavy module.</p>

<p align = "center">Real-Time Visualisation & Computer Graphics was split into two distinct sections: OpenGL and C++ visual programming section and a 3D Maths section. The 3D Maths section covered vectors, line/plane intersections, matrix operations, shading algorithms, the rendering pipeline, advanced rendering transformations (reflection, shadows), radiosity, ray-tracing and quaternions. In the programming section, I was tasked with a project to create a particle system, which you can see more of here.</p>

<p align = "center">The highest weighted module of this year was Aspects of Game Engine Development, which you can see in more detail here.</p>

<p align = "center">In third year I also worked as part of a three-person team to create Armoured Fighting Vehicles for the 2013 Games Fleadh as an extra-curricular project.</p>
