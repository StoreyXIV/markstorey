<p align = "center">Chronicles of Time was a 2D platformer created by myself and another student in Adobe Director (with Lingo). We created three levels featuring a scientist who had travelled to random points in time, who needed to reach his time machine to complete the level, avoiding obstacles and solving puzzles using his gravity gun. The game featured collision detection and gravity, as well as keyboard inputs to move the character.</p>
