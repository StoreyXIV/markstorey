<p align = "center">As part of a three-person team, I entered the 2013 Games Fleadh with a satirical tank war mobile game. The player would click on a room of their tank (on the left) then choose a target room on the enemy tank (on the right). These rooms had particular effects on the enemy tank, which gave an interesting game play as the player had to decide when to attack and when to defend in the turn-based environment. The game was written in C# and XNA and won the Best Original Innovation in Gaming award!</p>
