                    <p class="text-muted"> From 2010-2015 I undertook a Masters Degree in Computer Games Development at Queen's University Belfast and graduated with first-class honours.

                    My sights have always been on working in the games industry and I enjoy programming. I am also heavily interested in gaming, new technologies and the games industry as a whole.

                    I first began programming in Lower 6th of High School and started with Pascal. It was difficult but I developed a love for that feeling of accomplishment when a piece of code works. Since then I have worked in Java, C, C++ C#, among others.

                    Aside from work, I enjoy gaming, movies and television. Some would say I have an unhealthy addition to Pro Wrestling, Disney and Dr Pepper.</p>
