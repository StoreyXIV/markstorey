<p align = "center">This project was completed by a 3 man team and chosen to enter the Microsoft Imagine Cup. Geography Horizons is a Kinect Application with aspects of gamification used to transform the classroom. The application made use of Bing maps, streaming in the map of the world, allowing geography students to interact with the world and place markers were they believed certain landmarks where.

The idea was to test a studentâ€™s knowledge of locations of landmarks using elements from games; making the subject content more appealing. This project reached the Ireland regional finals of the 2012 Microsoft Imagine Cup.

When a student held their hand out, a menu would appear over the map giving the user 4 options: move left to zoom out, move right to zoom in, move up to place a pin or move down to cancel. The user would then pin where they thought volcanoes existed on the world map, then compare with the results at the end.</p>
