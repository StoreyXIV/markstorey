<p align = "center">The first year of my degree (September 2010 â€“ May 2011). Fundamentals of Programming and Programming Challenges taught the basics of programming with assessments carried out every few weeks. I had experienced programming in Pascal then later in Delphi in my A-Levels, so the new aspects here was Object-Orientated Programming using Java. Computer Architecture was a module consisting of programming in assembly, as well as learning binary, hex, computer arithmetic and logic circuits (all of which I had learnt or was introduced to at A-Level). Game Design I was a module that focused on the theory behind game design (this was the last remnant of the course being a Game Design and Development course before turning its attention to more of a programming/development course). We also created an Oblivion mod individually in this module. Introduction to Multimedia I was a team-based module, which saw random teams organised to create a Kiosk System. It was followed by the much superior Introduction to Multimedia II module which allowed you to choose a group and create a game. As part of a two-man team, I created a 2D Platformer in Adobe Director and Lingo which you can read about here.</p>
